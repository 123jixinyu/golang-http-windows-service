# Golang HTTP Server on Windows Service

This is simple Golang code for create web server which run as Windows Service and write log to Windows Event Log. I already tested on Windows 7, Windows 10 and Windows Server 2012.

This code has been developed from Golang Windows Service Example (https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/sys/windows/svc/example).
